## This is not one of my main projects, only a stupid resource pack
# Joe Grass Classic (1.6.1+)
Wanted Joe Locke in your Minecraft? In this resource pack, the grass block is modified to have the Joe Locke face!  
This new version features the classic Minecraft look, but all grass blocks, dirt blocks, and snow blocks now display the Joe Locke face! And you will have the Joe Locke face on the menu Screen!  
(Coming soon: Version without face on the menu)
# Joe Grass Beta
